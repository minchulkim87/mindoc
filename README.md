# mindoc.py

A minimalistic python and SQL documentation tool.

This program converts .py and .sql files into .html documentation files with minimal work on the developer's part.

(You can also use it to conver .md files to .html files in the same style if you wish)

The purpose is to minimise the documentation burden.

Simply write the code as if you would a markdown file with the documentation parts as comment blocks.

This tool also helps automatically generate a table of contents and cross-referencing.

mindoc also supports basic diagramming with markdown-like syntax.

Please see the documentation on GitHub to see how to install and use mindoc.
