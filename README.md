# mindoc

A minimalistic python documentation tool.

This program converts a .py file into a .html file to minimally document python code.

The purpose is to minimise documentation and to enable writing document-like .py files without a heavy imposition of the docstring burden.

Simply write the .py file as if you would a markdown file, but instead of writing the code blocks between text, write the text blocks between codes.

This tool also helps automatically generate a table of contents and cross-referencing.

Please see the documentation on GitHub to see how to install and use mindoc.
